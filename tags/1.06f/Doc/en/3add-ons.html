<p> To use other HTML documentations, you need to install an add-on for BeHappy. Some are available on <a href="http://www.becoz.org/beos" target="_blank">my web page</a>.
<p>To install a new add-on, just put it in BeHappy's Add-ons folder. Then you'll find the name of the documentation in BeHappy's 'Book' menu. If the name doesn't appear, it can be for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>The file is corrupted, and not recognised as an add-on. Try downloading it again.
<li>The add-on is too old or too recent for the version of BeHappy you use. (In that case, you'll see an error message). Try to always have the latest versions of both BeHappy and the add-ons you use. I hope I'll be able to maintain a compatibility with all the versions of BeHappy, but I can't guarantee this, unfortunately.
</ul>
<p>The first time the add-on is loaded, the HTML documentation is parsed to build the indexes. If you install a new version of the documentation, you must update the indexes. To do this, select the correct book in the 'Book' menu, and select 'Update' in the Action menu.
<p>You can also have more informations about the add-on with the 'About add-on' item in the Action menu.
